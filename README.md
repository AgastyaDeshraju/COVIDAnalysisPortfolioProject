# COVIDAnalysisPortfolioProject

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on publicly available COVID-19 data.

Data was downloaded from - [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) as a CSV file.

The data was then split into two tables - [Covid Deaths](https://github.com/AgastyaDeshraju/COVIDAnalysisPortfolioProject/blob/main/CovidDeaths.xlsx) & [Covid Vaccinations](https://github.com/AgastyaDeshraju/COVIDAnalysisPortfolioProject/blob/main/CovidVaccinations.xlsx).

Using SQL the data was then queried and various operations were performed to explore the dataset.

A visualization was then created on Tableau as a [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidDataAnalysisDashboard_16732582597960/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
